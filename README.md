# R-Trees
R-trees are tree data structures used for spatial access methods, i.e., for indexing multi-dimensional information such as geographical coordinates, rectangles or polygons. When the information is of spatial nature, then to obtain nearest neighbours of given queries, an R-tree is typically used.
